        "To really get that country feeling we recommend that you spend some time staring out at the rolling green pastures, curl up beside the stone fireplace in the winter months, or maybe whip up some scones in the country kitchen.",
        "If you feel like venturing a bit further afield then why not explore the countryside surrounding Coffs Harbour. You'll discover wide-open spaces, stunning national parks, wild waterfalls and great cafes.",
        "All our cottages are pet-friendly, so if your dog or cat needs a break from city life, bring them along to enjoy a bit of country. There's also a double pull out couch in the living room if you want to bring some extra humans as well."
